Drag List Box class
===================

Description:
This class uses APIs from ComCtl32.dll to create a drag list box (a list box that enables the user to drag items from one position to another).
It includes a class that will do all work for you (after having been initialized with three lines of code) and a sample showing how to do that.

Please note: You'll have to register the file SSubTmr.dll included in order to make it work properly.

VB6 users:
----------

In the VB6 subdirectory there's a version of the class modified to use the VB6 version of SSubTmr.dll (SSubTmr6.dll). Please use this version.
