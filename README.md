## DragListBox class


</div>

### Description

This submission uses APIs from ComCtl32.dll to create a drag list box (a list box that enables the user to drag items from one position to another).

It includes a class that will do all work for you (after having been initialized with three lines of code) and a sample showing how to do that.

Please note: You'll have to register the file SSubTmr.dll included in order to make it work properly.
